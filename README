What is it.
Attempt to create rich text editor that doesn't use browser's design mode or 
content editable to gain more control over output markup, and get possibility 
to generate different markups in the future.

Aim of initial commit.
Place source under version control, as long as it's size now exceeds 500 lines.

Currently tested under FF3.6, Chrome, Safari, Opera. Needs code clean-up and 
documentation.

TODO: 
 - test under IE (from version 7)
 - refactoring (also split source in logical modules, single file is a no-no)
 - documenting
