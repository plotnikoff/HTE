What is it.
Attempt to create rich text editor that doesn't use browser's design mode or 
content editable to gain more control over output markup, and possibly to 
generate different markups in the future.

Currently tested under IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6, Chrome, Safari, Opera. Needs code 
clean-up and documentation.
